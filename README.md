This is the readme file for CS Tools Lab Tasks. In this project, we learned to train our own supervised machine learning model using 
Iris Flower Classification Project with Machine Learning. Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, 
data visualization, model creation, etc.

Model Information:

Dataset: Iris Petals Database Model Type: Classification Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Programming Language: Python Libraries Used: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy 
Model Architecture: Linear SVM with One-vs-All (OvA) strategy for multiclass classification. 
Model Specifications:
Feature Space: The model uses four features from the Iris dataset: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
Target Variable: Species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). 
Training Method: The model was trained using supervised learning on labeled data. 
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy was used as the evaluation metric during training. Initial Accuracy:
Accuracy: After training on a subset of the Iris dataset, the initial accuracy achieved by the model was approximately 95%. This model serves as a classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal dimensions. With further optimization and tuning, the accuracy of the model can be improved.
